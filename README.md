# Python meets Fourier

A Jupyter notebook for a class presenting the discrete Fourier transform and applications to filtering and compressing audio, and blurring images.

At present GitHub's rendering of Jupyter notebooks is not very good (and is static!), so I recommend you download this directory to experiment with the techniques I present here.
